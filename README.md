### Documentation

I used unit testing with Selenium library in Python which is an open-source automation testing tool that comes as a testing suite with four different testing tools. 
It can be executed in multiple browsers and operating systems
Compatible with almost every programming language and testing framework
Allow you to run multiple tests at a time
Quickly identifies the elements with their id, name, X-path, etc.
The Do list Application is simple and I did some simple unit tests for each feature that I found. The features are including, 
adding an item, adding multiple items, clearing each item by clicking on that item, clear all items by pushing the clear all button, 
and also tested that if the app works on different browsers, such as Chrome, Firefox, IE, and Safari. 
I made sure every one of these features works with unit test.

Automation testing refers to the automation of the execution of test cases and comparing their results with the expected results. 
Depending on the application, different types of testing can be automated, such as unit testing, smoke testing, functional testing, integration testing and, 
regression testing.
I chose unit testing because it is the most basic type of testing and gives the ability to test every feature of a web application.
The unit test detects changes that may break a design contract. They help with maintaining and changing the code. 
Unit testing reduces defects in the newly developed features or reduces bugs when changing the existing functionality.
